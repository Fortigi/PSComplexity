## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-03
### Added
- `Measure-PSComplexity` - per-unit cyclomatic and cognitive complexity via the
  PowerShell AST (each function/filter, plus one `<script-body>` per file).
- `Test-PSComplexity` - CI gate returning `$false` (with a warning per offender) when
  any unit exceeds the cyclomatic or cognitive ceiling.
- Faithful SonarSource **cognitive** complexity: nesting-aware, boolean-run and
  labelled-jump and recursion increments, validated against reference scores
  (prime sieve = 7, switch = 1, recursive fibonacci = 3, `a -and b -or c` = 3).
- Cross-platform CI (Windows + Linux), PSScriptAnalyzer lint gate, self-complexity
  gate (the tool measures itself), code scanning, and a full-gated publish workflow.
